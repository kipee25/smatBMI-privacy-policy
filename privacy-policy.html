<h1>Privacy Policy — SmatBMI</h1>
<p>Effective: <strong>1 Sep 2025</strong></p>
<p>SmatBMI is a simple calculator. We do not collect personally identifiable information within the app. The app shows ads via Google AdMob, which may process device and usage data to deliver and measure ads.</p>
<h2>Advertising (AdMob)</h2>
<p>We use Google Mobile Ads SDK (AdMob) to display banner ads. AdMob may collect device identifiers (such as the Advertising ID), approximate location, and app interaction data to provide and measure ads. During development, we use Google’s test ad IDs.</p>
<p>Learn more in Google’s disclosures and controls:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://myadcenter.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">My Ad Center (ad personalization controls)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Data Safety (Google Play)</h2>
<p>On Google Play, we disclose use of the Google Mobile Ads SDK in the Data safety section, including the Advertising ID. We mark the app as “Contains ads”.</p>
<h2>Children</h2>
<p>SmatBMI is not directed to children under 13. We set conservative ad content settings (e.g., <em>PG</em> rating). Do not use the app if you are under the minimum age in your country.</p>
<h2>Medical Disclaimer</h2>
<p>BMI is a screening tool, not a diagnosis. It has limitations and may not reflect health status for athletes, older adults, or certain populations. Always consult a qualified healthcare professional.</p>
<h2>Contact</h2>
